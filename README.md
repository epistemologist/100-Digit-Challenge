# 100-Digit-Challenge

These are solutions to the [Hundred-dollar, Hundred-digit Challenge problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred-dollar,_Hundred-digit_Challenge_problems) posed by Professor Nick Trefethen implemented in Python as well as using additional scientific computing libraries (e.g. numpy, scipy, sympy for symbolic calculation, mpmath for extended precision)

Many of the approaches and exposition follow the amazing book written by one of the original contest's participants: [*The SIAM 100-Digit Challenge: A Study in High-Accuracy Numerical Computing*](http://www-m3.ma.tum.de/m3old/bornemann/challengebook/index.html)
