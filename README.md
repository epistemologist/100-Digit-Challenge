# 100-Digit-Challenge

These are solutions to the [Hundred-dollar, Hundred-digit Challenge problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred-dollar,_Hundred-digit_Challenge_problems) posed by Professor Nick Trefethen implemented in Python as well as using additional scientific computing libraries (e.g. numpy, scipy, sympy for symbolic calculation, mpmath for extended precision). Originally, these started as a final project for a class on [Computational Mathematics](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~hirani/teaching/490sp20/index.html), but I ended up continuing it after the class ended.

Many of the approaches and exposition follow the amazing book written by one of the original contest's participants: [*The SIAM 100-Digit Challenge: A Study in High-Accuracy Numerical Computing*](http://www-m3.ma.tum.de/m3old/bornemann/challengebook/index.html)

### TODO
 - Finish Problem 9 and 10
 - Solve some of the extra problems presented in Bornemann's book
 - add a pretty table to this README file linking to all the individual notebooks with the text of the problems
